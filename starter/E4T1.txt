# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Disable the password login on the WebApp EC2 instance
- Move the EC2 instance to a private subnet so it does not have a public routable IP.
- Limit the access to the instance (WebAppSG) to the admins IP's only.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Use least privilege access for the existing instance role profile to only allow access to specific buckets rather than using a wildcard(*).
- Implement a bucket policy to restrict access.
