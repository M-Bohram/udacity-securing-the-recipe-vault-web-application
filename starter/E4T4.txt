# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

1- Disable SSH access to the WebApp EC2 instance and rely on either a hardened bastion host or SSM to access the instance.
2- Move the EC2 instance to a private subnet with no routable IP and being accessed from ALB only and SSH IP's of the admin users only.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services 
powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring going to the internet and then to the S3 bucket or other AWS services, 
but even with that there is a risk of a malicious attack from the EC2 instance of the Web App.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, applying default encryption will not encrypt the existing files, just the future objects only, you have to encrypt the existing files (objects) manually.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The changes were made will be reverted or overridden by the next next cloudformation deployment.
