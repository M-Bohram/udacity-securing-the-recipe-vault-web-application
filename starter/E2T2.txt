Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

S3
- The block public access is disabled
- The data is not encrypted at rest (server-side encryption)

EBS
- The data is not encrypted at rest

WebAppEC2
- It has a public IP
- It is not managed by SSM

WebAppSG
- It has open ports (22 SSH, 3389 RDP) for the whole world, and they should be restricted

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:

1- Move the WebApp EC2 to a private subnet and make it access the internet using NAT gateway
2- Accessing the EC2 instance should be done using SSM session manager or from a hardened bastion host server that has public access but from certain IP's only
3- Restrict the IP's that can SSH or RDP to the WebAppSG to the admins IP's
4- Use EBS encrypted volumes (copy the current EBS volume and encrypted using KMS and replace it with the current one)
5- Enable block public access in S3 and use VPC endpoint to connect the EC2 instance with the bucket
6- Enable server-side encryption in the S3 bucket
